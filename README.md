The code of the article is divided into 3 main parts:
 1. Dataset Preprocessing
 2. Baseline Classifier Training and Concept-Based Interpretability Methodology
 3. Human-in-the-loop Approach

This code is adapted from the original implementation of the "Concept Activation Regions: A Generalized Framework For Concept-Based Explanations." [1] and the original code can be accessed at https://github.com/JonathanCrabbe/CARs
