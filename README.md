The research study of the article is divided into 3 main parts (illustrated by the following image) and in this repository, the code is divided into 4 folders:
 1. Dataset Preprocessing
 2. Baseline Classifier Training
 3. Implementation of the Concept-Based Interpretability Methodologies
 4. Human-in-the-loop Approach
